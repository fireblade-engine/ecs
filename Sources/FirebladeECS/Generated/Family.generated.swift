    /// Create a family of entities (aka members) having 8 required components.

    /// A family is a collection of entities with uniform component types per entity.
    /// Entities that are be part of this family will have at least the 8 required components,
    /// but may have more components assigned.
    ///
    /// A family is just a view on (component) data, creating them is cheap.
    /// Use them to iterate efficiently over entities with the same components assigned.
    /// Families with the same requirements provide a view on the same collection of entities (aka members).
    /// A family conforms to the `LazySequenceProtocol` and therefore can be accessed like any other (lazy) sequence.
    ///
    /// **General usage**
    /// ```swift
    /// let family = nexus.family(requiresAll: Comp1.self, Comp2.self, Comp3.self, Comp4.self, Comp5.self, Comp6.self, Comp7.self, Comp8.self)
    /// // iterate each entity's components
    /// family.forEach { (comp1, comp2, comp3, comp4, comp5, comp6, comp7, comp8) in
    ///   ...
    /// }
    /// ```
    /// **Caveats**
    /// - Component types must be unique per family
    /// - Component type order is arbitrary
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - comp1: Component type 1 required by members of this family.
    ///   - comp2: Component type 2 required by members of this family.
    ///   - comp3: Component type 3 required by members of this family.
    ///   - comp4: Component type 4 required by members of this family.
    ///   - comp5: Component type 5 required by members of this family.
    ///   - comp6: Component type 6 required by members of this family.
    ///   - comp7: Component type 7 required by members of this family.
    ///   - comp8: Component type 8 required by members of this family.
    ///   - excludedComponents: All component types that must not be assigned to an entity in this family.
    /// - Returns: The family of entities having 8 required components each.
